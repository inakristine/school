3. What does the return statement do?
The return statement exits the function. Anything written after the return statement, inside the function will not execute.

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');

"inside my function" will be written as an execution of the return statement. Then the function will be exited.


5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
